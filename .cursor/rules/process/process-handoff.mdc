      Blurb Creation Guidelines:

      1. Project Context Block:
         ```
         Project: [Project Name] (Phase [Number])
         Current State: [YYYY-MM-DD]
         Reference Plan: [path/to/plan.md]
         ```

      2. Completion Status:
         a) Recently Completed:
            - List 3-5 most recent completed items
            - Reference relevant files
            - Note any important implementation details

         b) Current State:
            - Active components
            - Working features
            - Known limitations
            - Recent test results

      3. Next Task Block:
         ```
         Next Task: [Task Name]
         Location: [File Path]
         ```

      4. Requirements Section:
         a) Core Requirements:
            - Numbered list of must-have features
            - Integration points
            - Expected behaviors
            - Performance criteria

         b) Technical Constraints:
            - Dependencies
            - Version requirements
            - System limitations
            - Thread safety concerns

      5. Reference Block:
         a) Critical Files:
            - Plan document
            - Related implementations
            - Test files
            - Documentation

         b) Integration Points:
            - Service connections
            - UI components
            - Database interactions
            - API endpoints

      6. Architecture Notes:
         - Reference to diagrams
         - System interactions
         - Data flow
         - State management

      7. Next Milestone:
         - Clear success criteria
         - Expected outcomes
         - Measurable goals

      8. Clipboard Action:
         - After generating blurb, copy to clipboard
         - Use pbcopy for macOS
         - Use clip for Windows
         - Use xclip for Linux

      Remember:
      - Keep it concise but complete
      - Include all necessary context
      - Reference specific files
      - Note current phase
      - Link to documentation
      - Highlight critical dependencies
      - Ensure blurb is copied to clipboard

metadata:
  priority: high
  version: 1.0
  tags:
    - documentation
    - handoff
    - project-management
    - agent-collaboration

## Usage

1. Before creating a handoff blurb:
   ```ruby
   fetch_rules(['blurb_handoff'])
   ```

2. Follow the template structure:
   ```
   [Project Context Block]
   [Completion Status]
   [Next Task Block]
   [Requirements Section]
   [Reference Block]
   [Architecture Notes]
   [Next Milestone]
   ```

3. Copy blurb to clipboard:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   echo "blurb_content" | pbcopy

   # Windows
   echo "blurb_content" | clip

   # Linux
   echo "blurb_content" | xclip -selection clipboard
   ```

## Integration

This rule should be used:
- When transitioning between development phases
- During agent handoffs
- When updating project status
- Before major implementation changes

## Benefits

1. Consistent Knowledge Transfer:
   - Standardized format
   - Complete context
   - Clear next steps
   - Clipboard availability

2. Reduced Onboarding Time:
   - All necessary references included
   - Clear status indicators
   - Explicit requirements
   - Easy sharing

3. Better Collaboration:
   - Shared understanding
   - Clear handoff points
   - Traceable progress
   - Quick distribution

## Maintenance

Update this rule when:
- New project phases are added
- Documentation requirements change
- Integration points are modified
- Process improvements are identified
- Clipboard commands need updating

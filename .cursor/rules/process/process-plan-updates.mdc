      Plan Update Guidelines:

      1. Surgical Focus:
         a) Phase Isolation:
            - Only update the current active phase
            - Leave future phases unchanged
            - Preserve original structure of other phases
            - Mark interrupted tasks as [INCOMPLETE]

         b) Task Status:
            - Use [x] for completed tasks
            - Use [ ] for pending tasks
            - Use [INCOMPLETE] for interrupted tasks
            - Maintain task hierarchy and indentation

         c) Task Additions:
            - Add new tasks only to current phase
            - Place new tasks in logical sequence
            - Maintain consistent formatting
            - Preserve task dependencies

         d) Task Updates:
            - Update only affected tasks
            - Keep unaffected tasks unchanged
            - Maintain original task descriptions
            - Preserve task IDs and references

      2. Change Documentation:
         a) Status Updates:
            - Document changes in updates.md
            - Reference specific tasks modified
            - Explain interruptions
            - Note any blockers

         b) Progress Tracking:
            - Update only completed tasks
            - Maintain task completion order
            - Document partial completions
            - Note dependencies affected

      3. Task Squashing/Summarizing:
         a) Completed Section Handling:
            - Once a section with subtasks is fully completed, squash it into a single summary item
            - Format: "[x] {Section Name} - Completed (N subtasks)" where N is the number of completed subtasks
            - Move original detailed tasks to updates.md for reference
            - Include completion date in the summary item

         b) Summarization Process:
            - Verify all subtasks are marked completed [x]
            - Create summary line with section header
            - Document key achievements or important notes
            - Remove detailed subtask lines
            - Document the summarization in updates.md

         c) Partial Completion:
            - Do not squash sections with incomplete tasks
            - Only summarize when all subtasks are done
            - Keep in-progress sections expanded

         d) Reference Format:
            ```markdown
            # Before Squashing
            ## Phase 1: Implementation
            - [x] Task 1.1: Setup development environment
              - [x] Subtask 1.1.1: Install dependencies
              - [x] Subtask 1.1.2: Configure environment variables
              - [x] Subtask 1.1.3: Setup testing framework
            
            # After Squashing
            ## Phase 1: Implementation
            - [x] Task 1.1: Setup development environment - Completed (3 subtasks) [2025-02-25]
            ```

      4. Version Control:
         a) Commit Strategy:
            - Commit only changed phase
            - Use clear commit messages
            - Reference task IDs
            - Note incomplete tasks
            - For squashed sections, use prefix: `squash(task-id): summarize completed section`

         b) Review Process:
            - Verify only intended changes
            - Check phase isolation
            - Validate task status
            - Confirm formatting
            - Ensure proper squashing of completed sections

      Remember:
      - Focus on current phase only
      - Document interrupted tasks
      - Maintain plan structure
      - Keep future phases intact
      - Update status in sync
      - Squash completed sections to reduce file size
      - Preserve detailed history in updates.md

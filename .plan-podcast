Podcast Processing Implementation: 🚧

Blurb:
The podcast processing system transforms audio/text podcasts into structured,
research-grade knowledge representations. Like a Wikipedia entry, it extracts
and organizes entities, events, timelines, quotes, and narratives, making
audio content visually navigable. The system must handle multi-hour podcasts
and produce output detailed enough for researchers to enrich through additional
research and web browsing. This transforms podcasts from linear audio/text into
interconnected knowledge graphs.

Podcast Processing Implementation: 🚧

1. Core Processing Architecture:
   [ ] Design processing pipeline for podcast content:

   - Input handling (audio/transcript)
   - Chunking strategy for long content
   - Parallel processing capabilities
   - Result combination and synthesis
   - Progress tracking and state management

2. Knowledge Extraction Pipeline:
   [ ] Implement extraction stages:

   - Entity recognition (people, places, organizations)
   - Event detection and timeline construction
   - Quote extraction and attribution
   - Story/narrative identification
   - Topic modeling and theme extraction
   - Relationship mapping between entities

3. Visual Knowledge Representation:
   [ ] Create visualization components:

   - Knowledge graph visualization
   - Interactive timeline
   - Entity relationship diagrams
   - Quote browser
   - Story map interface
   - Topic/theme clusters

4. Research Support Features:
   [ ] Implement research tools:

   - Annotation system
   - Source linking
   - Web research integration
   - Citation management
   - Export capabilities
   - Collaborative editing

5. Data Model and Storage:
   [ ] Design data structures for:

   - Processed podcast metadata
   - Extracted knowledge graph
   - Research annotations
   - Entity relationships
   - Timeline data
   - User enrichments

6. UI/UX Implementation:
   [ ] Create interface components:

   - Podcast upload/input interface
   - Processing progress visualization
   - Knowledge browser
   - Research workspace
   - Export interface
   - Collaboration tools

7. Performance Optimization:
   [ ] Implement performance features:

   - Chunked processing
   - Parallel execution
   - Progress caching
   - Incremental updates
   - Lazy loading
   - State persistence

8. Integration Features:
   [ ] Add integration capabilities:
   - Web research tools
   - External databases
   - Citation systems
   - Export formats
   - API access
   - Backup/restore

Current Issues:

1. Pipeline Flow Issues:
   [!] Unclear processing flow (step-by-step vs all-at-once)
   [!] Competing methods in ProcessingPipeline (process vs processStep)
   [!] Missing step dependencies and order
   [!] Poor result sharing between steps

2. State Management Issues:
   [!] Split state between UI and Pipeline
   [!] Unclear state ownership
   [!] Missing result caching
   [!] Incomplete progress tracking

3. Strategy Interface Issues:
   [!] Overloaded ProcessingStrategy responsibilities
   [!] Unclear contract with optional methods
   [!] Poor separation of concerns
   [!] Insufficient type safety

4. Architecture Issues:
   [!] Mixed chunking and processing logic
   [!] Missing error recovery
   [!] No retry mechanism
   [!] Can't resume from failures

5. UI Feedback Issues:
   [!] Inaccurate progress indicators
   [!] Missing step-level feedback
   [!] Hidden intermediate results
   [!] Poor error visibility

6. Performance Issues:
   [!] Missing large input strategy
   [!] No intermediate caching
   [!] Duplicate processing
   [!] No process cancellation

[Implementation Plan]

1. Core Processing Architecture:
   [ ] Design processing pipeline for podcast content:
   - Input handling (audio/transcript)
   - Chunking strategy for long content
   - Parallel processing capabilities
   - Result combination and synthesis
   - Progress tracking and state management

[... rest of the implementation plan remains the same ...]

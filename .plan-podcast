Podcast Processing Implementation: 🚧

Blurb:
The podcast processing system transforms audio/text podcasts into structured,
research-grade knowledge representations. Like a Wikipedia entry, it extracts
and organizes entities, events, timelines, quotes, and narratives, making
audio content visually navigable. The system must handle multi-hour podcasts
and produce output detailed enough for researchers to enrich through additional
research and web browsing. This transforms podcasts from linear audio/text into
interconnected knowledge graphs.

Current Status:
✅ Schema alignment complete:

- Fixed ContentAnalysis schema and mock data
- Added QA schema with enhanced features
- Fixed type imports and linter errors
- Added proper entity typing
- Added timeline data with full schema compliance

Next Steps:

1. Block System Migration
   - Convert PodcastResults to use block components
   - Implement timeline visualization
   - Add entity visualization
   - Set up proper data flow

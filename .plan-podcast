Podcast Processing Implementation: 🚧

Blurb:
The podcast processing system transforms audio/text podcasts into structured,
research-grade knowledge representations. Like a Wikipedia entry, it extracts
and organizes entities, events, timelines, quotes, and narratives, making
audio content visually navigable. The system must handle multi-hour podcasts
and produce output detailed enough for researchers to enrich through additional
research and web browsing. This transforms podcasts from linear audio/text into
interconnected knowledge graphs.

Current Status:
🚫 BLOCKED: Schema misalignment between mock data and actual schemas

- Mock data in podcast-results.ts doesn't match ContentAnalysis schema
- Missing proper entity typing from PodcastEntities
- Linter errors in type imports
- Timeline and theme data incomplete

   [ ] Add missing schema fields
   [ ] Validate against Zod schemas
   [ ] Update ProcessedPodcast type
   [ ] Enhance transformers
   [ ] Add visualization types

2. Knowledge Extraction Pipeline: 🚧
   [✓] Basic entity recognition
   [✓] Advanced entity recognition
   [✓] Event detection
   [✓] Timeline construction

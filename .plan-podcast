Podcast Processing Implementation: 🚧

Blurb:
The podcast processing system transforms audio/text podcasts into structured,
research-grade knowledge representations. Like a Wikipedia entry, it extracts
and organizes entities, events, timelines, quotes, and narratives, making
audio content visually navigable. The system must handle multi-hour podcasts
and produce output detailed enough for researchers to enrich through additional
research and web browsing. This transforms podcasts from linear audio/text into
interconnected knowledge graphs.

1. Core Processing Architecture: ✅
   [✓] Design processing pipeline for podcast content:
   [✓] Input handling (audio/transcript)
   [✓] Chunking strategy for long content
   [✓] Parallel processing capabilities
   [✓] Result combination and synthesis
   [✓] Progress tracking and state management

2. Knowledge Extraction Pipeline: 🚧
   [ ] Implement extraction stages:
   [✓] Basic entity recognition (speakers)
   [✓] Advanced entity recognition (places, organizations)
   [✓] Event detection and timeline construction
   [ ] Quote extraction and attribution
   [ ] Story/narrative identification
   [ ] Topic modeling and theme extraction
   [ ] Relationship mapping between entities

3. Visual Knowledge Representation: ⏳
   [ ] Create visualization components:
   [ ] Knowledge graph visualization
   [ ] Interactive timeline
   [ ] Entity relationship diagrams
   [ ] Quote browser
   [ ] Story map interface
   [ ] Topic/theme clusters

4. Research Support Features: ⏳
   [ ] Implement research tools:
   [ ] Annotation system
   [ ] Source linking
   [ ] Web research integration
   [ ] Citation management
   [ ] Export capabilities
   [ ] Collaborative editing

5. Data Model and Storage: 🚧
   [✓] Processed podcast metadata
   [✓] Basic knowledge graph
   [✓] Timeline data
   [ ] Research annotations
   [ ] Entity relationships
   [ ] User enrichments

6. UI/UX Implementation: 🚧
   [✓] Podcast upload/input interface
   [✓] Processing progress visualization
   [ ] Knowledge browser
   [ ] Research workspace
   [ ] Export interface
   [ ] Collaboration tools

7. Performance Optimization: ✅
   [✓] Chunked processing
   [✓] Parallel execution
   [✓] Progress caching
   [✓] Incremental updates
   [✓] Lazy loading
   [✓] State persistence

8. Integration Features: ⏳
   [ ] Web research tools
   [ ] External databases
   [ ] Citation systems
   [ ] Export formats
   [ ] API access
   [ ] Backup/restore

Current Issues:

1. Pipeline Flow Issues: ✅
   [✓] Unclear processing flow (step-by-step vs all-at-once)
   [✓] Competing methods in ProcessingPipeline (process vs processStep)
   [✓] Missing step dependencies and order
   [✓] Poor result sharing between steps

2. State Management Issues: ✅
   [✓] Split state between UI and Pipeline
   [✓] Unclear state ownership
   [✓] Missing result caching
   [✓] Incomplete progress tracking

3. Strategy Interface Issues: ✅
   [✓] Overloaded ProcessingStrategy responsibilities
   [✓] Unclear contract with optional methods
   [✓] Poor separation of concerns
   [✓] Insufficient type safety

4. Architecture Issues: ✅
   [✓] Mixed chunking and processing logic
   [✓] Missing error recovery
   [✓] No retry mechanism
   [✓] Can't resume from failures

5. UI Feedback Issues: 🚧
   [✓] Inaccurate progress indicators
   [✓] Missing step-level feedback
   [ ] Hidden intermediate results
   [ ] Poor error visibility

6. Performance Issues: ✅
   [✓] Missing large input strategy
   [✓] No intermediate caching
   [✓] Duplicate processing
   [✓] No process cancellation

Next Priority Tasks:

1. Quote extraction and attribution
2. Improve UI Feedback for intermediate results
3. Implement Visual Knowledge Representation
4. Add Research Support Features

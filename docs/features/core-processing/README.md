# Core Processing Feature

## Overview

The Core Processing feature provides a unified interface for processing different types of content (podcasts, posts) through a common pipeline. It uses an adapter pattern to handle format-specific processing while maintaining a consistent interface.

## Purpose and Goals

- Provide a unified interface for content processing
- Support multiple content formats through adapters
- Handle validation, processing, and error states consistently
- Enable format-specific processing features when needed
- Maintain type safety and clear interfaces

## Key Functionalities

- Content validation
- Format-specific processing
- Entity extraction
- Sentiment analysis
- Timeline generation (for podcasts)
- Error handling and status tracking

## Dependencies

- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- Podcast feature for podcast-specific processing
- Posts feature for post-specific processing

## Status

### Current State

- Core processing structure implemented
- Adapter pattern in place
- Unit tests complete
- Integration with podcast and post features

### Planned Improvements

- Add more content formats
- Enhance error handling
- Improve performance
- Add more analysis options

### Known Limitations

- Limited to text-based content

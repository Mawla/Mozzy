# Task Plan (cursor-rules-update-20240320)

## Current Status

### 2024-03-20 18:45

**Status**: Completed

- What's working: All sections completed - Memory Management, Documentation Standards, Version Control Integration, Cross-Reference System, and Observability
- What's not: N/A
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Move task to completed status

## Problem Analysis

- Current cursor rules need comprehensive update
- Memory management section needs restructuring
- Documentation references are outdated
- Cross-referencing between systems missing
- Task management needs standardization

## Solution Design

### Approach: Comprehensive Rules Update

- Description: Complete restructuring of cursor rules with focus on memory and documentation management
- Pros:
  - Clearer organization of project memory
  - Better task tracking and relationships
  - Improved documentation standards
  - Clear version control integration
- Cons:
  - Requires careful migration of existing content
  - Need to maintain backward compatibility
- Technical considerations:
  - Must maintain markdown compatibility
  - Must work with existing tools
- Security implications:
  - None, documentation only

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Update Memory Management Section

  - [ ] Add Long-Term Memory section
  - [ ] Remove outdated references (composer-history, plan-podcast.md)
  - [ ] Define memory types (Working/Project/Documentation)
  - [ ] Add memory cleanup and retention policies

- [ ] Create Documentation Standards Section

  - [ ] Add /docs usage guidelines
  - [ ] Include file_structure_document.md maintenance rules
  - [ ] Define documentation update procedures
  - [ ] Add cross-referencing guidelines

- [ ] Add Version Control Integration

  - [ ] Define git commit patterns for memory files
  - [ ] Add plan update commit guidelines
  - [ ] Create branch naming conventions

- [ ] Improve Task Management

  - [ ] Create explicit task naming convention
  - [ ] Add task relationship format
  - [ ] Define blocking/blocked notation
  - [ ] Add categorization system

- [ ] Add Cross-Reference System

  - [ ] Create links between memory types
  - [ ] Add references between tasks and docs
  - [ ] Define reference format standards

- [ ] Create Observability Section
  - [ ] Move logging under observability
  - [ ] Add monitoring guidelines
  - [ ] Include debugging practices
  - [ ] Link with memory management

## Affected Components

- `.cursorrules`
  - Complete restructuring needed
  - High impact, core documentation
- `/docs/working-memory/`
  - Update structure documentation
  - Medium impact, task management
- `/docs/`
  - Add new documentation standards
  - High impact, project documentation

## Testing Plan

- [ ] Verify markdown formatting
  - Check all code blocks
  - Verify list indentation
- [ ] Test documentation links
  - Internal references
  - Cross-references
- [ ] Validate examples
  - Task creation examples
  - Memory management examples

## Monitoring

- Review task creation patterns
- Monitor documentation updates
- Track cross-reference usage
- Observe git commit patterns

## Rollback Plan

- Keep backup of original .cursorrules
- Document all changes in progress history
- Maintain list of modified files

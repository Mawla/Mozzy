# Team Members Recursion Fix

## Overview

This implementation resolves the "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'team_members'" error. The issue was occurring when trying to access team memberships within the RLS (Row Level Security) policies.

## Root Cause

The problem was in the "Team members can view other team members" policy, which caused a circular reference:

1. To view team members, the policy checks if the user is in the same team
2. But to check if the user is in the team, it tries to read from the team_members table
3. This triggers the RLS policy check again, causing infinite recursion

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

Created a new migration file that:

- Replaces problematic RLS policies with safer versions
- Creates SECURITY DEFINER functions that bypass RLS
- Adds helper functions for checking team membership
- Adds a function to retrieve team IDs without triggering RLS

**File:** `/supabase/migrations/20250423_fix_team_members_recursion.sql`

### 2. Server Actions Update

Modified the getPosts function in posts.ts to:

- Use the new `get_user_team_ids` RPC function to safely get team IDs
- Add a fallback method if the RPC call fails
- Improve error handling and logging
- Maintain the original functionality

**Files modified:**

- `/app/actions/posts.ts`

## Implementation Notes

1. **RLS Bypass Strategy**

   - Created SECURITY DEFINER functions that run with elevated privileges
   - These functions can read the team_members table without triggering RLS
   - Policies use these functions instead of direct queries

2. **Performance Benefits**

   - Reduced query complexity by directly fetching team IDs
   - Eliminated redundant checks through better function design
   - Added proper error handling for robustness

3. **Improved Error Handling**

   - Added better error logging
   - Implemented fallback strategy for team membership queries
   - Ensures posts are still returned even when team queries fail

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any remaining recursion issues
2. Consider extending the approach to other tables if needed
3. Add tests to verify the fix works as expected

## Testing Notes

To verify the implementation:

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the dashboard/posts page (which triggers the getPosts function)
3. Verify no recursion errors are logged
4. Confirm posts from both the user and their teams are displayed

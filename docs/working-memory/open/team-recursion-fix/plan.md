# Team Members Recursion Fix - 2025-04-23

## Problem Analysis

The application is encountering an "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'team_members'" error. This is happening when trying to access team memberships within the Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Specifically, the error occurs in the getPosts function when attempting to fetch team memberships to determine which team posts a user should see.

### Error Details

```
[ERROR] Failed to fetch team memberships {
  code: '42P17',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "team_members"'
}
```

### Root Cause

The infinite recursion is caused by the "Team members can view other team members" policy. When this policy executes, it checks if the user is a member of the team by querying the team_members table. However, this query triggers the policy check again, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution Design

The solution needs to break the circular reference by:

1. **Using SECURITY DEFINER Functions**: These functions bypass RLS and run with elevated privileges, allowing safe access to the team_members table.

2. **Replacing Direct Queries**: Instead of directly querying the team_members table in policies, use helper functions that can safely perform these checks.

3. **Improving Error Handling**: Enhance the server action to be more resilient to failures in team membership queries.

## Implementation Steps

1. [x] Analyze the existing RLS policies and identify those causing recursion
2. [x] Create SECURITY DEFINER functions for safely checking team membership
   - [x] is_in_same_team function for checking general membership
   - [x] is_team_owner function for checking ownership
   - [x] get_user_team_ids function for retrieving all team IDs for a user
3. [x] Drop the problematic RLS policies
4. [x] Create new policies that use the helper functions
5. [x] Update the getPosts function in actions/posts.ts
   - [x] Use get_user_team_ids RPC function for primary access
   - [x] Add fallback to direct query with proper error handling
   - [x] Fix type issues in error handling
6. [x] Create documentation in the working memory folder
   - [x] README.md with explanation of the issue and solution
   - [x] updates.md with implementation status
   - [x] plan.md (this file) with detailed analysis
7. [ ] Run the migration against the development database
8. [ ] Test the application to ensure posts are properly fetched
9. [ ] Monitor for any remaining RLS issues

## Affected Components

- **Database**: RLS policies and helper functions for team_members table
- **Server Actions**: posts.ts, specifically the getPosts function
- **Documentation**: Working memory files for tracking the fix

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these changes, the application should:

1. Successfully fetch team memberships without recursion errors
2. Display both user posts and team posts on the dashboard
3. Maintain proper security through RLS while avoiding the recursion issue
4. Be more resilient to failures through improved error handling

## Dependencies

- Supabase database with proper permissions to update RLS policies
- Existing team_members table structure
- Next.js server actions framework

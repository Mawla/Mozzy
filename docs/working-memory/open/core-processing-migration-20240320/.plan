# Core Processing Migration Task

## Current Status

### 2024-03-20 14:00

**Status**: In Progress

- What's working: Core processing exists in podcast feature
- What's not: Not shared with posts feature
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Begin migration plan

## Problem Analysis

- Core processing functionality currently lives in `/app/core/processing`
- Needs to be shared between podcast and posts features
- Current implementation is podcast-specific
- Need to abstract common processing patterns

## Solution Design

### Approach 1: Shared Library Module
- Create a new shared processing library
- Abstract common functionality
- Implement feature-specific adapters
- Maintain single source of truth

Pros:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable across features
- Easier maintenance
- Single source of truth

Cons:
- Initial migration effort
- Potential breaking changes
- Need to handle feature-specific cases

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Analysis Phase
  - [ ] Review current processing code
  - [ ] Identify common patterns
  - [ ] Document feature-specific requirements
  - [ ] Map data structures

- [ ] Design Phase
  - [ ] Design shared interfaces
  - [ ] Plan adapter pattern
  - [ ] Define migration strategy
  - [ ] Create test plan

- [ ] Implementation
  - [ ] Create shared module structure
  - [ ] Migrate core functionality
  - [ ] Implement podcast adapter
  - [ ] Implement posts adapter
  - [ ] Add tests
  - [ ] Update documentation

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit tests
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] Migration validation
  - [ ] Performance testing

## Affected Components

### Files to Update
- `/app/core/processing/**/*`
- `/app/dashboard/podcasts/**/*`
- `/app/dashboard/posts/**/*`
- Documentation files

### Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Update podcast feature docs
- [ ] Update posts feature docs
- [ ] Create core processing feature docs
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams

## Dependencies

- Blocks: Future post processing implementation
- Related: Podcast feature, Posts feature

### 2025-01-19 17:55 - New Strategy to Resolve Repeated Type Issues

- **Goal**: Break the problem/solution loop by creating a clear and methodical approach to unify and maintain shared types in core processing modules.

#### Plan Outline

1. **Centralize and Validate Base Types**

   - Create or confirm a single "base.ts" file in "/app/core/processing/types/" for all fundamental interfaces.
   - Export only stable, widely-used interfaces here (e.g., ProcessingResult, ProcessingState).
   - Enforce that format-specific types extend these base interfaces, instead of duplicating type definitions.

2. **Establish Type Ownership**

   - Assign a single "type owner" or point-of-contact for each domain (podcast, posts, analytics), who ensures new definitions align with the base types.
   - Before merging related code, review any new or changed interfaces against the base definitions.

3. **Set Up Automated Type Checks**

   - Implement a CI step specifically checking for type coverage and interface compatibility.
   - Catch redundant or conflicting types by comparing all TypeScript declarations in "/app/core/processing" and "/app/types".
   - Use strict compiler flags (e.g., "strictNullChecks") to prevent silent type conflicts.

4. **Incremental Migration**

   - Gradually unify each feature's type definitions under the shared "base.ts".
   - Create tasks for removing or replacing old type duplicates.
   - Track each removal or consolidation in a separate type-chore commit.

5. **Documentation & Governance**
   - Update "docs/features/core-processing/" to reflect the new centralized type strategy.
   - Document each interface, its purpose, and ownership (podcast vs. posts vs. generic).
   - Encourage team to follow these doc references to avoid reintroducing duplicate or conflicting types in the future.

#### Next Steps

1. **Create a dedicated "type-chore" branch.**
2. **Audit all existing .ts files** for duplicate or partial interfaces that need merging into base.ts.
3. **Update or remove** conflicting definitions in feature-specific adapters.
4. **Review and merge** with team feedback to ensure future type additions follow the new approach.

**Status**: Plan Proposed – to be executed by agent or developer as part of final type system cleanup.

### 2025-01-19 18:00 - Type System Restructuring Plan

✓ Analysis Complete:

- Identified circular dependencies between base and feature-specific types
- Found redundant type definitions and inconsistent extensions
- Discovered type re-export issues causing confusion

🤔 Decisions:

1. **Type Hierarchy Restructuring**

   - Move entity types to a shared location (`app/types/entities`)
   - Create clear type inheritance chain
   - Eliminate circular dependencies

2. **Type Organization**

   ```
   app/types/
   ├── entities/                    # Shared entity types
   │   ├── base.ts                 # Base entity interfaces
   │   ├── podcast.ts              # Podcast-specific entities
   │   └── post.ts                 # Post-specific entities
   ├── processing/
   │   ├── base.ts                 # Core processing interfaces
   │   ├── podcast/                # Podcast processing types
   │   │   ├── index.ts           # Public API
   │   │   └── internal.ts        # Internal types
   │   └── post/                   # Post processing types
   │       ├── index.ts           # Public API
   │       └── internal.ts        # Internal types
   └── shared/                     # Shared utility types
       └── index.ts
   ```

3. **Type Definition Rules**
   - Base types should not import from feature-specific modules
   - Feature types must extend base types consistently
   - Use composition over inheritance where possible
   - Minimize type re-exports

❌ Implementation Steps:

1. **Phase 1: Entity Types Separation**

   - [ ] Create `app/types/entities` directory
   - [ ] Move entity interfaces from podcast schemas
   - [ ] Update imports in affected files
   - [ ] Validate no circular dependencies

2. **Phase 2: Processing Types Restructuring**

   - [ ] Create new type hierarchy in `app/types/processing`
   - [ ] Move base types from core processing
   - [ ] Implement feature-specific type extensions
   - [ ] Update type imports across codebase

3. **Phase 3: Type Usage Updates**

   - [ ] Update all type imports to use new structure
   - [ ] Remove redundant type definitions
   - [ ] Fix inconsistent type extensions
   - [ ] Add type documentation

4. **Phase 4: Validation & Testing**
   - [ ] Add type validation tests
   - [ ] Verify no breaking changes
   - [ ] Update affected components
   - [ ] Run full test suite

⏭️ Next Steps:

1. Create new type structure
2. Migrate existing types
3. Update imports
4. Validate changes

**Success Criteria**:

- No circular type dependencies
- Clear type hierarchy
- Consistent type extensions
- Reduced type duplication
- All tests passing
- No breaking changes

## Progress History

### 2025-01-24 14:40 - Core Features Migration Planning

‚úì Completed:

- Identified core features for migration
- Reviewed feature documentation
- Created initial migration strategy
- Documented dependencies and relationships

ü§î Decisions:

- Migrate core processing first as it's a dependency
- Keep type system structure but implement in Ruby
- Rename posts feature to social-posts
- Use service objects for processing strategies

‚ùå Issues:

- Complex type system needs careful translation to Ruby
- Tight coupling between features requires coordinated migration
- Audio processing dependencies need evaluation

‚è≠Ô∏è Next:

- Create core processing migration guide
- Begin type system migration
- Set up base service structure
- Plan integration testing strategy

### Required Emoji Markers:

‚úì Completed: Work completed
ü§î Decisions: Key decisions made
‚ùå Issues: Problems encountered
‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Upcoming work
üìö Documentation: (when docs affected)

### Update Process:

1. Get current timestamp:
   ```bash
   date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
   ```
2. Move current status to Progress History
3. Update Current Status with new timestamp
4. Verify checklist at top of file

### Template Usage Notes:

1. ONLY ONE Current Status entry should exist at any time
2. Before updating status:
   - Copy current status to Progress History
   - Update timestamp using `date` command
   - Replace current status with new status
3. Keep Progress History chronological (newest at bottom)
4. Use emoji markers consistently
5. Link to specific files/components
6. Reference task ID in all updates
7. Keep entries focused and concise

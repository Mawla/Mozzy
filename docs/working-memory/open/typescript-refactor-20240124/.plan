**Status**: In Progress

What's working:

- Fixed ProcessingChunk interface inheritance

- Created new podcast type system
- Added progress field to all processing steps
- Fixed type exports in podcast/types.ts

What's not:

- 226 TypeScript errors across 75 files
- Major issues with entity type compatibility
- Missing required fields in several interfaces
- Import path issues for types
- Duplicate type declarations
- Missing exports for several types
- Conflicts with exported declarations in base.ts

Next actions:

1. Fix entity type compatibility:

   - Add missing required fields (size, category, domain, examples)
   - Update mock data to include required fields
   - Fix entity merging functions
   - Ensure all entity types have required fields:
     - PersonEntity: expertise (string[])
     - OrganizationEntity: size (string)
     - TopicEntity: category (string), relevance (number), subtopics (string[])
     - ConceptEntity: domain (string), examples (string[])
     - EventEntity: date (string), duration (string), participants (string[])

2. Fix import paths:

   - Update relative imports to use @/app/types
   - Remove duplicate type declarations
   - Fix circular dependencies
   - Update imports in podcast/processing.ts to use ProcessingResult instead of BaseProcessingResult

3. Fix ProcessingChunk interface:

   - Add missing progress field
   - Update all implementations
   - Fix TextChunk to include required fields

4. Fix ContentMetadata interface:

   - Add required fields (format, platform, processedAt)
   - Update all usages to include required fields

5. Fix duplicate declarations:

   - Remove re-exports in base.ts
   - Fix conflicts in podcast/types.ts
   - Fix conflicts in podcast/index.ts

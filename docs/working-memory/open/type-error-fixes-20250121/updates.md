## Current Status

### 2025-01-21 14:30

**Status**: In Progress

- What's working:

  - Fixed missing type exports in app/types/index.ts
  - Added proper exports for podcast processing types
  - Added re-exports from models.ts
  - Fixed import paths

- What's not:

  - models.ts file should be consolidated into proper type system structure
  - Need to verify remaining type errors
  - Need to check component usage of new types
  - Need to verify build process

- Next actions:
  1. Consolidate models.ts:
     - Move Podcast interface to /app/types/entities/podcast.ts
     - Move PodcastAnalysis to /app/types/processing/podcast.ts
     - Move ContentSection, Section to /app/types/shared/content.ts
     - Move Concept, Argument, Controversy, Quote to /app/types/shared/analysis.ts
     - Move Application to /app/types/shared/application.ts
     - Move ProcessingStatus, ProcessingStep to /app/types/processing/base.ts
     - Move PodcastInput, ProcessingResult to /app/types/processing/podcast.ts
     - Move PodcastTranscript to /app/types/processing/podcast.ts
     - Move ProcessedPodcast to /app/types/processing/podcast.ts
     - Move PodcastEntities to /app/types/entities/podcast.ts
     - Move TimelineEvent to /app/types/shared/timeline.ts
     - Move PodcastProcessingState to /app/types/processing/podcast.ts
  2. Update all imports to use new locations
  3. Delete models.ts after migration
  4. Run type checker to verify fixes
  5. Check component imports
  6. Update documentation

## Progress History

### 2025-01-21 14:30 - Models Consolidation Plan

‚úì Completed:

- Analyzed models.ts content
- Created consolidation plan
- Identified proper type locations
- Prepared for type migration

ü§î Decisions:

- Move entity types to entities/
- Move processing types to processing/
- Create new shared type files for common types
- Follow type system structure from .cursorrules

‚ùå Issues:

- models.ts violates type system structure
- Some types have inconsistent naming
- Some types have duplicate definitions
- Need to handle circular dependencies

‚è≠Ô∏è Next:

- Execute consolidation plan
- Update all imports
- Delete models.ts
- Verify type system

### 2025-01-21 14:25 - Type Export Fixes

‚úì Completed:

- Added missing type exports to app/types/index.ts
- Fixed podcast processing type exports
- Added re-exports from models.ts
- Fixed import paths

ü§î Decisions:

- Re-export all podcast-specific types from processing.ts
- Keep models.ts as source of truth for podcast models
- Use explicit type exports for clarity

‚ùå Issues:

- Found circular dependencies in type imports
- Discovered duplicate type definitions
- Found inconsistent type naming

‚è≠Ô∏è Next:

- Run type checker to verify fixes
- Check component usage
- Update documentation

# Type System Cleanup Status

## Current Status (2025-02-08 16:23)

**Phase**: Implementation Phase - LocationEntity Updates

**Completed Tasks**:

1. Detailed analysis of `LocationEntity` type system
2. Detailed analysis of `PersonEntity` type system
3. Created comprehensive entity relationship diagrams
4. Documented type hierarchy and validation flow
5. Mapped feature-specific extensions
6. Created detailed `LocationEntity` improvement plan
7. Documented `LocationEntity` implementation strategy
8. Implemented `LocationType` enum and `Coordinates` interface
9. Updated base `LocationEntity` with new type system
10. Updated feature-specific implementations (podcast and post)

**Key Findings**:

1. Entity type system follows a consistent inheritance pattern:
   - Base entities define core fields
   - Feature-specific entities extend base types
   - Common validation schemas for each level
2. Identified areas for improvement:
   - Some duplication in feature-specific types
   - Inconsistent validation schema implementation
   - Missing JSDoc documentation in places
   - Opportunity to standardize relationship handling
3. LocationEntity specific findings:
   - Type inconsistency between base and feature implementations
   - Validation schema inconsistencies across implementations
   - Field standardization needed for coordinates and location types
   - Documentation gaps in JSDoc comments and examples

**Next Immediate Actions**:

1. Create test suite for new LocationEntity implementation
2. Update existing code to use new LocationType enum
3. Add missing JSDoc documentation to all entity types
4. Standardize relationship handling across entity types

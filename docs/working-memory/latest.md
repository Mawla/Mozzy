### Authentication Issues Resolution

- Identified cookie modification errors in server components
- Found session management issues in posts page
- Updated plan to include new authentication tasks
- Added error handling improvements to roadmap

### Terminal Log Analysis

1. Cookie Modification Error:

   - Location: utils/supabase/server.ts
   - Issue: Attempting to modify cookies outside Server Actions
   - Impact: Authentication state not persisting
   - Next Steps: Move cookie operations to Server Actions

2. Posts Page Authentication:
   - Location: app/dashboard/posts/page.tsx
   - Issue: User authentication failing
   - Impact: Unable to fetch posts
   - Next Steps: Implement proper session management

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Updated plan.md with new authentication tasks
- [x] Identified root cause of cookie modification errors
- [x] Documented authentication flow issues
- [x] Created new tasks for error handling improvements

### Next Actions

1. Create dedicated server actions for auth operations
2. Update middleware to handle cookie operations
3. Implement proper session management
4. Add error boundaries for auth failures

### Technical Debt

1. Authentication Flow:

   - Need to refactor cookie handling to use Server Actions
   - Implement proper session refresh logic
   - Add error boundaries for auth failures

2. Error Handling:
   - Add global error handling for auth failures
   - Implement proper error messages for users
   - Add retry logic for failed auth operations

### Notes

- Current authentication implementation needs significant updates to work with Next.js 14 server components
- Cookie handling needs to be moved to Server Actions as per Next.js documentation
- Session management needs to be implemented properly to prevent unexpected logouts

# Task Plan (auth-fix-20240320)

## Status Update (2024-03-20 16:30)
- Login form now rendering correctly
- Auth UI working but redirection after login failing
- Session cookie being set but not persisting
- Next: Fix redirection flow and session persistence

## Previous Status (2024-03-20 16:00)
- Skipping logger initialization fix for now
- Focusing on core auth form rendering issue
- Will comment out logger code to prevent initialization errors
- Next: Debug AuthForm component mounting

## Problem Analysis

- Login form not rendering on /login page
- Multiple refresh token errors in logs
- Excessive cookie operations detected
- Auth UI component may not be properly initialized

## Affected Components
- app/components/auth/auth-form.tsx
- app/login/page.tsx
- app/actions/auth.ts
- app/lib/supabase.ts

## Impact Assessment
- Users cannot log in
- Session management is broken
- Multiple unnecessary cookie operations impacting performance

## Solution Design

1. Redirection Flow Fix:
   - Implement proper callback handling
   - Add session validation before redirect
   - Ensure cookie persistence across redirects
   - Handle error cases with fallback routes

2. Session Management:
   - Verify cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, path)
   - Implement proper session persistence
   - Add session recovery mechanism
   - Handle token refresh flow

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Fix Redirection Flow
  - [ ] Update callback route to handle session properly
  - [ ] Add session validation before redirect
  - [ ] Implement proper error redirection
  - [ ] Test all auth flows (login, logout, social)

- [ ] Improve Session Management
  - [ ] Fix cookie persistence
  - [ ] Add session recovery
  - [ ] Implement token refresh
  - [ ] Add session validation

- [ ] Fix Logger Initialization
  - [ ] Check logger provider implementation
  - [ ] Verify setupBrowserLogging export
  - [ ] Add error handling for logger init
  - [ ] Test logger in isolation

- [ ] Debug Auth UI Component
  - [ ] Add console logs for component lifecycle
  - [ ] Test component in isolation
  - [ ] Verify client-side hydration
  - [ ] Check for CSS conflicts

- [ ] Fix Session Management
  - [ ] Clear invalid tokens
  - [ ] Implement token refresh flow
  - [ ] Add token validation
  - [ ] Optimize cookie operations

- [ ] Add Error Handling
  - [ ] Create AuthErrorBoundary
  - [ ] Add fallback UI
  - [ ] Implement retry mechanism
  - [ ] Add user feedback

## Progress Log
2024-03-20 16:30:
- Login form now rendering and functional
- Identified redirection issues after successful login
- Session cookie not persisting properly
- Next: Implement proper redirection flow and session persistence

2024-03-20 16:00:
- Decided to skip logger fixes temporarily
- Prioritizing auth form rendering
- Next: Debug AuthForm component with console logs

2024-03-20 15:30:
- Identified issue with login form not rendering
- Found excessive cookie operations in logs
- Refresh token errors indicating potential session management issues
- Next: Will check login page component and auth form initialization

## Success Criteria
- Login form renders correctly
- No refresh token errors in logs
- Reduced cookie operations
- Proper error handling and recovery

## Monitoring
- Watch for auth-related errors in logs
- Monitor cookie operations frequency
- Track component rendering issues
- Verify session persistence
